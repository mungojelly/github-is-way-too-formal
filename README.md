# github-is-way-too-formal

Hello There, wtf is going on here? This is the main place we talk in
code and everything everyone says is monumentally boring. It's like
this is the linkedin of code social networks and no other social
networks exist. All anyone has to say is how employable they think
they are or would like to be. Am I missing something? Are you even
allowed to say things here? Is this repo even allowed? I feel like I'm
not even allowed to say any simple thing because this place is so
unbelievably, totally, massively square.
